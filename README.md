# NameSuggestor
Concept: Use machine learning to suggest names to a user based on inputted names 
and traits they desire in the name. Very practical for naming characters in a 
story, or for looking for baby names.

Implementation Overview: A python program that uses a naive bayes classifier in 
NLTK, several input text files with lists of names, and the desired traits of 
the character the user is naming. The classifier determines which features are 
most important to the user by finding commonalities between user-provided names 
and traits.
